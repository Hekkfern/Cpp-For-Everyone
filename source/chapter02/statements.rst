2.1 Statements
###############

A computer program is a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what to do. A statement is a type of instruction that causes the program to perform some action.

They are the smallest independent unit of computation in the C++ language. In C++, the orders that tell the program what to do are the statements.

Most (but not all) statements in C++ end in a semicolon. If a line ends in a semicolon, it's probably a statement.

In a high-level language such as C++, a single statement may compile into many machine language instructions.
