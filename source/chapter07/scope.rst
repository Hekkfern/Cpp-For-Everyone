Scope
#######

An identifier's **scope** determines where the identifier can be accessed within the source code. When an identifier can be accessed, it is said it is **in scope**. When an identifier can not be accessed, it is said it is **out of scope**. Scope is a compile-time property, and trying to use an identifier when it is not in scope will result in a compile error.

Variable names must be unique within a given scope, otherwise any reference to the name will be ambiguous.
